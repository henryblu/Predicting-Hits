# Predicting Hits
This repositry contains the code for the data-Science mini project "predicting hits"

In this mini project, we solve the following problem: 
How can you find what playlists have the most commonalities with your songs? 
To solve this problem, we created a web application that uses the URL of an input song to recommend five Spotify official playlists with similar music to that song. Our project uses Spotify's open-source API data to train a machine-learning classification model that finds playlists with similar characteristics to a given song.
