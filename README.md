# Predicting Hits
This repositry contains the code for the data-Science mini project "predicting hits"

In this mini project, we solved the following problem: 
How can you find what playlists have the most commonalities with a given song? 
To solve this problem, we created a web application that uses the URL of an input song to recommend five Spotify official playlists with similar music to that song. Our project uses Spotify's open-source API data to train a machine-learning classification model that finds playlists with similar characteristics to a given song. 

We encourage you to try the deliverable of the project here:

(Unfortunately, we had no power over the URL and the website can sometimes take a while to load in)

As of december 2022 Heroku no longer has a plan for free cloud hosting, thus the website has shut down.
